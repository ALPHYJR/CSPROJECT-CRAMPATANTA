                              <p>A pleasant day to you, viewer! I am Alphy D. Crampatanta Jr., the publisher of this website. This website mainly focuses on the significant contributions of computer science in our lives and how it paved the way for the flourishing of inventive creations that entertain our efficiency in terms of health, communication, and more. This encompasses active careers, degrees, and college courses in which we can partake in the future, as well as the wages in particular computer science-inclined careers. This site also offers programming languages, in order to encourage users who are still developing their interest in computer science to learn and discover the beauty of computer science. Additionally, this also tackles the impacts on my life, particularly how it displaced me to a point where my interest in programming immensely increased, and how it enclosed me to a place where it provided me several opportunities that are greatly related to computer science such as the Kidsâ€™ Innovation Challenge and National Youth Science, Technology, and Innovation Festival.
